  # The Gospel of Matthew

  ## Chapter 6 - Seeking God’s Kingdom First
¹ Be careful not to perform your religious duties in front of others just to be seen and praised by them. If gaining human approval is your primary motivation, you'll receive no reward from God the Father who values sincere hearts above public displays of piety.

² When you give to those in need, don't announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in places of worship and on streets. They seek human praise as their full reward, but this temporary recognition cannot compare to God the Father's eternal approval.

³ Instead, when giving to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. This metaphor means keeping your generosity so private that you almost forget your own acts of kindness rather than dwelling on them with pride.

⁴ Give in secret where only God the Father sees, and He will reward you openly in His timing and way. This reward may come as inner peace, spiritual growth, or future blessing rather than immediate material prosperity or public recognition.

⁵ When you pray, don't be like hypocrites who love standing in worship places and street corners to be seen praying. They perform for human audiences, missing the true purpose of prayer as intimate communication with God the Father.

⁶ When you pray, go into your private room, close the door, and pray to God the Father who is unseen. He sees what happens in secret places and will reward authentic relationship with Him through answered prayers and spiritual transformation.

⁷ When praying, don't babble with meaningless repetitions like those who don't know God the Father, thinking they'll be heard because of many words. Prayer effectiveness doesn't depend on length or eloquence but on sincerity and alignment with God's will.

⁸ Don't pray like them, for God the Father knows what you need before you ask. Prayer's purpose isn't informing God of needs He's unaware of, but developing relationship with Him and aligning your heart with His perfect purposes.

⁹ Pray like this: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored as holy." This acknowledges God's parental love yet sovereign majesty, beginning prayer with worship rather than requests, recognizing His perfect character deserves reverence.

¹⁰ "May your Kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven." This expresses desire for God the Father's perfect rule to transform our troubled world, submitting our agenda to His wiser purposes.

¹¹ "Give us today our daily bread." This acknowledges God the Father as provider of all physical and spiritual necessities, teaching dependence on Him for each day's needs rather than anxious stockpiling for uncertain futures.

¹² "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." This recognizes our need for forgiveness while committing to extend the same mercy to others who harm us. Receiving God's forgiveness creates obligation to forgive others.

¹³ "Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one." This humbly admits our vulnerability to spiritual deception and moral failure, seeking God the Father's protection from situations beyond our spiritual strength to resist.

¹⁴ If you forgive others when they sin against you, God the Father will forgive your sins as well. Your treatment of others reveals your true understanding of the mercy you've received and affects your spiritual relationship with God.

¹⁵ But if you refuse to forgive others, God the Father will not forgive your sins. An unforgiving spirit demonstrates you haven't truly grasped your own need for mercy and blocks your ability to experience God's forgiveness fully.

¹⁶ When fasting, don't look somber like hypocrites who disfigure their faces to show others they're fasting. They've received their full reward in human recognition, missing the spiritual benefits that come from genuine self-denial focused on God.

¹⁷ When fasting, comb your hair and wash your face so your fasting isn't obvious to others. This maintains the private nature of spiritual discipline as between you and God the Father rather than as public performance.

¹⁸ Fast in a way that only God the Father, who sees what is done in secret, will notice. He will reward genuine spiritual hunger that seeks Him rather than human approval, with deeper intimacy and spiritual growth through the discipline.

¹⁹ Don't store up treasures on earth where insects and rust destroy, and thieves break in and steal. Material possessions are temporary and vulnerable to loss, providing false security that disappears when economic conditions change or death comes.

²⁰ Instead, store up treasures in heaven where insects and rust cannot destroy, and thieves cannot break in and steal. Eternal investments in God's Kingdom through generosity, service, and spiritual growth yield permanent rewards.

²¹ For wherever your treasure is located, there your heart will be also. Your financial priorities reveal and reinforce your deepest values and loves, either tying your affections to temporary earthly concerns or eternal spiritual realities.

²² The eye functions as the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, seeing clearly, your whole body will be full of light, representing spiritual discernment that guides all aspects of life toward truth.

²³ But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is actually darkness through self-deception, how deep that darkness becomes! Spiritual blindness is most dangerous when mistaken for insight.

²⁴ No one can serve two masters simultaneously. Either you'll hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God the Father and money as your primary loyalty or source of security.

²⁵ Therefore I tell you, don't worry about your life—what you'll eat or drink, or about your body—what you'll wear. Life consists of more than food, and the body more than clothing. Anxiety about basics reveals misplaced trust.

²⁶ Look at the birds flying above. They don't plant, harvest, or gather into barns, yet God the Father feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than birds? If God cares for lesser creatures, He will certainly provide for His children.

²⁷ Who among you by worrying can add even one hour to your lifespan? Anxiety accomplishes nothing productive while stealing joy and peace. It cannot extend life but instead diminishes the quality of the life you have.

²⁸ And why worry about clothing? Consider how wildflowers grow. They don't labor or spin thread, yet their beauty surpasses Solomon's royal garments. God's provision extends beyond necessities to beauty and dignity.

²⁹ Yet I tell you that not even King Solomon in all his splendor was dressed as beautifully as these flowers. If God clothes temporary plants with such attention to detail and beauty, He will surely provide for your needs.

³⁰ If God the Father clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! Trust God's provision before assuming the worst.

³¹ So don't worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?' These anxious questions reveal a heart that has forgotten God's faithful character and the priority of seeking Him first.

³² People who don't know God the Father run after all these things desperately, but your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. He is aware of every necessity before you ask and has promised to provide.

³³ Seek first God the Father's kingdom and His righteousness, and all these necessary things will be given to you as well. Make your primary pursuit spiritual growth and Kingdom purposes, trusting material provision to follow.

³⁴ Therefore don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Live fully present in today's challenges and opportunities rather than borrowing tomorrow's troubles prematurely.

  ## Chapter 18 - Humility, Forgiveness, and Lost Sheep
¹ At that time the disciples approached Jesus asking, "Who is considered greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?" Their question revealed their continuing misunderstanding of spiritual greatness, still thinking in terms of worldly power and position.

² Jesus called a small child to stand among them in the middle of their circle. By using this living object lesson, He challenged their assumptions about greatness through someone society considered insignificant and without status.

³ Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change direction and become like little children in trust and humility, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Adult pride and self-sufficiency block genuine spiritual receptivity to God's grace.

⁴ Therefore, whoever humbles themselves like this child demonstrates true greatness in the Kingdom of Heaven. Greatness comes through lowering yourself, not exalting yourself—a complete reversal of the world's understanding of importance and power.

⁵ And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me personally. How you treat the vulnerable, powerless members of society reflects your true attitude toward Jesus himself, revealing your heart's condition better than religious performances.

⁶ But whoever causes one of these little believers in me to stumble into sin would be better off having a large millstone hung around their neck and being drowned in the deepest part of the sea.

⁷ How terrible for the world because of things that cause people to sin! Such temptations must come, but terrible consequences await anyone through whom they come. The inevitability of temptation doesn't remove responsibility from those who promote sin.

⁸ If your hand or foot causes you to stumble into sin, cut it off and throw it away. Better to enter eternal life disabled than to have both hands or feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

⁹ And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. Better to enter eternal life with one eye than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Radical separation from sin matters more than physical comfort.

¹⁰ Be careful not to look down on these little ones. I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. God the Father values and protects the vulnerable whom the world dismisses as unimportant.

¹¹ For the Son of Man came to seek and save what was lost, demonstrating God the Father's priority of restoration rather than condemnation. This redemptive purpose should shape our treatment of others, especially those who have strayed.

¹² What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one wanders away, won't they leave the ninety-nine on the hillside to search for the wandering one? Each individual matters deeply to God the Father.

¹³ And if they find it, truly I tell you, they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that didn't wander off. This doesn't diminish love for those who stayed, but celebrates the restoration of what was in danger.

¹⁴ In the same way, your Father in heaven doesn't want even one of these little ones to perish spiritually. God's heart desires everyone's salvation, especially those most vulnerable to being led astray or overlooked by religious communities.

¹⁵ If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out their fault. If they listen and acknowledge it, you have won your brother or sister back. Begin conflict resolution with direct, private conversation rather than public exposure.

¹⁶ But if they won't listen, take one or two others with you so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. These additional people provide objectivity and prevent misrepresentation of what was said.

¹⁷ If they still refuse to listen, tell the church community. And if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector—with evangelistic love seeking restoration rather than continuing close spiritual fellowship.

¹⁸ Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Church discipline properly conducted carries divine authority when aligned with scripture and led by the Holy Spirit.

¹⁹ Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. Unity in prayer multiplies spiritual power, especially when based on scriptural promises and God's revealed will.

²⁰ For where two or three gather together in my name, there I am with them. Jesus' presence isn't limited to large gatherings but is promised even to the smallest assembly that meets with Him as their focus and purpose.

²¹ Then Peter approached Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times should I forgive someone who sins against me? Up to seven times?" Peter thought he was being generous, significantly exceeding the traditional three-time forgiveness limit of rabbinical teaching.

²² Jesus answered, "Not seven times, but seventy-seven times," meaning forgiveness should be unlimited and unmeasured. Keeping count of offenses reveals an unforgiving spirit still seeking to limit mercy rather than reflecting God's boundless grace.

²³ Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants who managed his money. This parable illustrates God's forgiveness and our responsibility to extend similar mercy to others.

²⁴ As he began the settlement, a man who owed ten thousand talents was brought to him. This astronomical sum—equivalent to millions of dollars today—represents our unpayable debt of sin against a perfectly holy God the Father.

²⁵ Since he couldn't pay, his master ordered that he, his wife, his children, and everything he owned be sold to repay the debt. This severe consequence illustrates sin's serious nature, destroying relationships and causing complete loss without mercy's intervention.

²⁶ The servant fell on his knees before him, begging, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything.' Though repayment was impossible, the desperate plea acknowledged the debt and sought mercy from the one wronged.

²⁷ The servant's master felt compassion, canceled the debt, and let him go. This represents God the Father's incredible mercy that doesn't merely postpone punishment but completely removes the debt of sin when we genuinely seek forgiveness.

²⁸ But when that servant left, he found a fellow servant who owed him a hundred denarii—about three months' wages. Though significant, this amount was infinitesimal compared to what he had been forgiven, just as others' sins against us pale compared to ours against God.

²⁹ His fellow servant fell down and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back'—using nearly identical words to the first servant's earlier plea, highlighting the parallel situation and opportunity for him to extend similar mercy.

³⁰ But he refused and had his fellow servant thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. His hardheartedness revealed he hadn't truly understood or internalized the mercy he had received, viewing it as his right rather than undeserved gift.

³¹ When the other servants saw what happened, they were greatly distressed and went to tell their master everything that had happened. The community recognized the injustice and incongruity between mercy received and mercy withheld.

³² Then the master called the first servant and said, 'You wicked servant! I canceled all your debt because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had mercy on you?'

³³ In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he paid back all he owed. The severe consequence illustrates that refusing to forgive others blocks our ability to experience God the Father's forgiveness fully.

³⁴ This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart. Genuine forgiveness isn't merely external performance but internal release of resentment and desire for revenge.

³⁵ Forgiveness must be sincere and complete, not just verbal or superficial. God the Father, who sees the heart's true condition, knows whether we've truly forgiven others as completely as we desire to be forgiven ourselves.
