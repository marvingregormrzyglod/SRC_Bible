# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for wanting to improve SRC! 
You’re helping build a unique resource for the Church—see the LICENSE for how we protect that mission.

By contributing to SRC (via pull requests, edits, or feedback), you agree to:
- You gift your work to this project, transferring copyright to me (Marvin Gregor Mrzyglod) so I can steward SRC as a unified whole.
- You agree your contributions will remain freely available online for others to read and discuss—but not to redistribute separately (e.g., as a standalone book or app).
- You waive legal claims to your edits (this protects the project from disputes).
