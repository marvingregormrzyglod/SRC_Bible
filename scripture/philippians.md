  # The Letter to the Philippians

## Chapter 2 - The Humility of Christ and the Call to Unity
¹ If our connection with Jesus has given you any encouragement, if His love has provided any comfort, if the Holy Spirit has created any fellowship among us, if you've experienced any tenderness or compassion from God the Father, then respond to these blessings by uniting with fellow believers.

² Make my joy complete by thinking the same way, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and focusing on one purpose together. This unity doesn't mean uniformity but harmony in essential beliefs while accepting diversity in non-essentials.

³ Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride that seeks attention or praise. Instead, with true humility consider others as more important than yourselves, focusing on their needs before your own desires and comfort.

⁴ Don't look out only for your own interests and concerns, but actively look for ways to help with the interests of others. This balance prevents self-centeredness while still practicing appropriate self-care that enables sustained service.

⁵ Your attitude should be the same as that of Jesus, who demonstrated perfect humility, service, and obedience to God the Father even when it led to suffering and death on your behalf.

⁶ Though Jesus existed in the very nature of God the Father from eternity past, He didn't consider His equality with God something to be grasped and displayed. He willingly set aside His divine privileges for our salvation.

⁷ Instead, Jesus emptied himself of His heavenly glory, taking on the humble position of a servant by becoming human. He who created all things limited Himself to experience hunger, thirst, pain, and all other human limitations.

⁸ Jesus humbled himself further by living obediently even to the point of experiencing death—not just any death, but the shameful, painful death on a cross reserved for the worst criminals, though He was completely innocent.

⁹ Therefore God the Father exalted Jesus to the highest place of honor and authority, giving Him the name above every other name in heaven and earth. This name represents His character, authority and saving power over all creation.

¹⁰ God did this so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow in acknowledgment of His lordship—beings in heaven, people on earth, and even those under the earth will recognize His sovereignty and rightful rule.

¹¹ Every tongue will openly acknowledge that Jesus is Lord of all creation, bringing ultimate glory to God the Father. This universal confession, whether willing or unwilling, will establish Christ's complete victory over all opposition.

¹² Therefore, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed when I was with you, now continue working out your salvation with deep reverence and trembling while I'm away. This isn't working for salvation but working from salvation already received.

¹³ For God the Father Himself is working in you, giving you both the desire and the power to do what pleases Him. Your transformation comes not through self-effort alone but through the Holy Spirit's empowering presence within you.

¹⁴ Do everything without complaining or arguing against God's instructions or with fellow believers. Such negative attitudes damage community, discourage others, and demonstrate ingratitude toward God the Father's provisions and guidance.

¹⁵ Then you will be blameless and pure, children of God the Father without fault in a crooked and perverse generation. Among them you will shine like stars in the night sky, attracting others to the light of Jesus through your distinctly different lives.

¹⁶ Hold firmly to the life-giving message about Jesus so that when He returns, I can proudly say I didn't run or labor for nothing. Your faithful endurance proves the effectiveness of the gospel message I shared with you.

¹⁷ Even if my life is poured out like a drink offering accompanying your faith offered to God the Father, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. My potential suffering and sacrifice complements your faithful service to Jesus.

¹⁸ You too should be glad and rejoice with me in this shared privilege of suffering for Jesus. Instead of viewing hardship as punishment, see it as participation in Christ's own suffering that deepens your relationship with Him.

¹⁹ I hope in Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so I can be encouraged when he returns with news about your faith. Timothy's report will provide comfort during my imprisonment by confirming your continued spiritual growth.

²⁰ I have no one else like Timothy who genuinely cares about your welfare as I do. Unlike others who pursue personal interests, he seeks Jesus' purposes and your spiritual growth with sincere devotion.

²¹ Everyone else seems concerned about their own interests rather than the interests of Jesus. They prioritize personal comfort, safety or advancement over Kingdom purposes and the spiritual needs of others.

²² But you know Timothy's proven character, that like a son with his father, he has served with me in promoting the good news about Jesus. His consistent faithfulness through hardship demonstrates his genuine commitment to Christ.

²³ Therefore I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with my legal situation. My uncertainty about my trial's outcome prevents immediate travel plans, but I'll send him when my circumstances become clearer.

²⁴ And I trust in Jesus that I myself will come to visit you soon as well. This confidence isn't based on wishful thinking but on my faith that God the Father will work through even Roman authorities to accomplish His purposes.

²⁵ Meanwhile, I considered it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger whom you sent to take care of my needs during my imprisonment.

²⁶ He longs to see all of you and has been distressed because you heard he was ill. His concern for your worry shows his deep love for you, prioritizing your emotional well-being above his own physical suffering.

²⁷ Indeed he was so sick that he nearly died, but God the Father had mercy on him—and not just on him but also on me, to spare me from having sorrow upon sorrow during my already difficult imprisonment.

²⁸ Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety. His return will comfort both you and me, demonstrating how Christian relationships ease burdens.

²⁹ Welcome him in Jesus with great joy, and honor people like him highly. Those who risk their health and safety to serve others deserve special recognition from the community of believers as examples of Christ-like sacrifice.

³⁰ For he nearly died for the work of Jesus, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me. His physical presence provided what your distance prevented, making him your representative in meeting my needs.
