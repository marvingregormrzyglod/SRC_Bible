Scripture Reimagined as Code (SRC) – Copyright License
Copyright © Marvin Gregor Mrzyglod 2025. All rights reserved.

Thank you for your interest in Scripture Reimagined as Code (SRC)! This project is a labor of love, dedicated to making God’s Word accessible in a fresh way. To protect the integrity of this work while encouraging community participation, please review these terms:

# For Everyone (General Use)
### You are welcome to:
- Quote up to 500 verses (or 25% of your work, whichever is less) for non-commercial purposes like sermons, studies, or church materials—just include this attribution: “From Scripture Reimagined as Code (SRC), Used by permission.”
- Display SRC in worship services or small groups (e.g., projections, handouts) with the same attribution.

### You must ask first if you’d like to:
- Use SRC in products for sale (books, apps, etc.).
- Reprint large portions (over 500 verses) or entire books.
- Modify or adapt the text (e.g., translations, paraphrases).

(Email requests to marvingregor@yandex.com—I’m happy to discuss!)

# For Contributors (Collaborators on GitHub)
By contributing to SRC (via pull requests, edits, or feedback):
- You gift your work to this project, transferring copyright to me (Marvin Gregor Mrzyglod) so I can steward SRC as a unified whole.
- You agree your contributions will remain freely available online for others to read and discuss—but not to redistribute separately (e.g., as a standalone book or app).
- You waive legal claims to your edits (this protects the project from disputes).

# What’s Not Allowed (To Protect the Project)
- No redistributing SRC in full (digitally or in print) without permission.
- No reproducing, modifying or use in derivative works unless approved.
- No commercial use without prior agreement.

# Why These Terms?
This license ensures:
- Community can engage—your ideas improve SRC for everyone.
- Integrity is preserved—no fragmented or misrepresented versions.
- Generosity is balanced with care—like the parable of the talents (Matt. 25:14–30), we steward this work responsibly.
