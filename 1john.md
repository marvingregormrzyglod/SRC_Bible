# The 1st Letter of John

## Chapter 3 - Children of God
¹ See what amazing love God the Father has given us, that we should be called His children - and that is truly what we are! The world doesn't recognize us as God's family because the world didn't recognize Jesus when He was here.

² Dear friends, we are already God the Father's children right now, but what we will become in the future hasn't yet been revealed. We know that when Jesus appears at His return, we'll become like Him because we'll see Him as He truly is.

³ Everyone who has this confident hope of transformation fixed on Jesus purifies themselves just as He is pure. This ongoing sanctification process flows naturally from anticipating our future complete Christlikeness as motivation for present holiness.

⁴ Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, because sin is lawlessness at its core. Sin isn't merely breaking arbitrary rules but rebelling against God the Father's character revealed in His commands that express His perfect nature and wisdom.

⁵ You know that Jesus appeared to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin whatsoever. His sinless perfection qualified Him to be our substitute, demonstrating both the possibility and necessity of living in alignment with God the Father's will.

⁶ No one who lives in continuous relationship with Jesus keeps on sinning deliberately; anyone who continues practicing sin hasn't truly seen Him or known Him. Genuine spiritual connection with Christ produces progressive transformation of desires and behaviors.

⁷ Dear children, don't let anyone lead you astray through false teaching. The person who practices righteousness consistently is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous. Authentic spiritual life inevitably produces visible moral fruit that reflects Christ's character.

⁸ The person who practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. Jesus appeared for this purpose: to destroy the devil's work that enslaves humanity to destructive patterns contrary to our created purpose.

⁹ No one born of God the Father continues practicing sin because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning because they have been born of God. The new nature implanted through spiritual rebirth creates resistance against sin's former dominance.

¹⁰ This is how we distinguish between God the Father's children and the devil's children: anyone not practicing righteousness is not from God, nor is anyone who fails to love their brothers and sisters in Christ. Behavior reveals spiritual parentage.

¹¹ This is the message you have heard from the beginning of Christ's teaching: We should love one another genuinely, not just in words but through practical actions that meet real needs and build up the community of believers.

¹² Don't be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because Cain's own actions were evil while his brother's actions were righteous. Hatred often springs from conviction about our own wrongdoing.

¹³ Don't be surprised, dear family members in Christ, if the world hates you. This hostility is expected because your transformed values and priorities stand as living condemnation of worldly systems built on selfishness, greed, and immediate gratification.

¹⁴ We know we have passed from spiritual death to eternal life because we love our fellow believers. Anyone who doesn't love remains in spiritual death, separated from the life-giving connection with God the Father that transforms relationships with others.

¹⁵ Anyone who hates another believer is effectively a murderer at heart, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in them. Jesus taught that hatred is the root attitude from which murder springs, making it spiritually equivalent.

¹⁶ This is how we know what genuine love is: Jesus laid down His life for us sacrificially. Therefore we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters, placing their needs above our comfort through practical service and sacrificial giving.

¹⁷ If anyone has material possessions and sees a fellow believer in need but shows no compassion, how can God the Father's love be living in that person? Genuine spiritual life inevitably produces compassionate response to others' tangible needs.

¹⁸ Dear children, let's not love with empty words or meaningless speech but with truthful actions. Our practical service to others demonstrates the reality of our love more convincingly than emotional declarations or theological knowledge ever could.

¹⁹ This practical love is how we know we belong to the truth and how we can reassure our hearts whenever our hearts condemn us with doubt and guilt about our spiritual condition. Obedience provides evidence of genuine relationship with God the Father.

²⁰ For whenever our hearts condemn us, God the Father is greater than our hearts and knows everything about us. His perfect knowledge includes both our failures and our genuine faith, providing more reliable assessment than our fluctuating emotions.

²¹ Dear friends, if our hearts don't condemn us because we're walking in obedience and love, we have confidence when approaching God the Father in prayer. Our assurance before Him grows as our lives increasingly align with His revealed will.

²² We receive from Him whatever we ask because we keep His commands and do what pleases Him. This doesn't mean God the Father automatically grants our every request, but that obedience aligns our desires with His purposes, transforming what we ask for.

²³ And this is His command: to believe in the name of His Son, Jesus, and to love one another as He commanded us. This simple twofold emphasis on faith and love summarizes the essence of Christian life, uniting right belief with right practice.

²⁴ The one who keeps God the Father's commands lives in Him, and He in them. And this is how we know that He lives in us: We know it by the Holy Spirit He gave us who produces godly character and confirms our adoption as God's children.
